In this example we tackled the problem with Expression Language......

The problem we faced was we were not able to use the Expression language.....

The solution to this problem was to set isELIgnored attribute in <@page> directory to false set to false...
But to this we have to first make some changes to to the web.xml file...
The web.xml file provided by maven is not upto date...
Thus to make it upto date first remove the DOCTYPE tag from the xml file.....


Then replace your <web-app> header tag with following code.....


<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<web-app xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" 
  xmlns:web="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee  http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_2_5.xsd"
  version="2.5">
  
  
  And your problem will be solved.........
