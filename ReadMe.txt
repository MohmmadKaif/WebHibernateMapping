This is application is for reference for future project....


(**) Some key points to remember...
  1) This application demonstrates how to use OneToMany And ManyToOne Mapping...
  2) Always when implementing a OneToMany and ManyToOne Hibernate mapping always remember that the Entity which will be having many OneToMany annotation, the 
     Object of such class will be create first... 
  3) Then the entity having ManyToOne annotation objects will be created and in each object we will be adding the the object of Entity 
     having OneToMany, along with this we will be adding it in List
  4) Now we will add this List to the object of Entity with OneToMany annotation....
  
(**) Using mappedBy attribute
   1) If we don't use mappedBy attribute an extra table will be be created....
   2) To avoid this we use mappedBy Attribute with Entity having annotation OneToMany...
